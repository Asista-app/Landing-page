    <section class="card">
      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide the Services (manage conversations, place/receive calls on your behalf, fulfill requests).</li>
        <li>To generate daily insights and analytics that help you monitor performance and responsiveness.</li>

      <p>Depending on your location, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (to deliver the Services you request).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., service improvement, fraud prevention) balanced against your rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> where required (e.g., for call recording or certain analytics features).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> (when we must retain or disclose information under applicable laws).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Sharing & Disclosure</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers/Processors</strong>: hosting, communications (e.g., WhatsApp Business Platform), telephony,
            analytics, and support tools operating under contracts that limit their use of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: if we undergo a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, data may transfer as part of the transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal</strong>: to comply with law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental requests; to protect rights,
            property, or safety of users and the public; to enforce our terms or prevent abuse.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        We may process and store data in countries outside your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for legitimate business needs (e.g., accounting,

      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect personal information. No method of transmission or storage
        is 100% secure; we continuously improve our safeguards to reduce risk.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
